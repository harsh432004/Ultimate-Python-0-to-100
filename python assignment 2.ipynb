    "Ans. In Python, a while loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is true.\n",
    "It is a pre-test loop, which means that the condition is tested at the beginning of each iteration.\n",
    "If the condition is true, the loop body will be executed, and then the condition will be tested again.\n",
    "The loop continues until the condition becomes false.\n",

    "    # code to be executed repeatedly while condition is true\n",

    "Here, the condition is a Boolean expression that evaluates to True or False. The code block inside the loop is executed repeatedly as long as the condition is true.\n",
