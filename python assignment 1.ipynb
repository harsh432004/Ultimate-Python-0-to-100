The following are some of the most common types of code blocks used in Python:\\n\\n1. Function blocks: Functions in Python are defined using the \"def\" keyword, followed by the function name and its arguments. The code block for the function is indented under the function definition and the code should be executed when the function is called.\\nFor example:\\ndef my_function(argument1, argument2):\\n\\n2. Conditional blocks: Conditional statements in Python, such as \"if\", \"elif\", and \"else\", are used to execute different code blocks based on the result of a Boolean expression. The code block for each branch of the conditional is indented under the relevant keyword.\\nFor example:\\nif x > 0:\\n# Code to be executed if x is greater than 0\\nelif x == 0:\\n# Code to be executed if x is equal to 0\\nelse:\\n# Code to be executed if x is less than 0\\n\\n3. Loop blocks: Loops in Python, such as \"for\" and \"while\", are used to execute a block of code repeatedly. The code block for the loop is indented under the loop definition.\\nFor example:\\nfor i in range(10):\\n# Code to be executed for each value of i in the range 0 to 9\\n\\nwhile x > 0:\\n# Code to be executed as long as x is greater than 0\\n\\n4. Class blocks: Classes in Python are defined using the \"class\" keyword, followed by the class name and any base classes. The code block for the class is indented under the class definition.\\n\\n5. With blocks: The \"with\" statement in Python is used to manage resources like files, sockets, and locks, and ensures that they are properly closed or released when the block is exited. The code block for the \"with\" statement is indented under the statement itself.\\n\\nThese are just a few examples of code blocks used in Python.

It can be used to print text strings, numbers, variables, and more.\\nFor example:\\nprint(\"Hello Mentor ! \\n Nice to meet you Sir ^.^ \")\\n\\n2. len() - This function is used to get the length of a string, list, tuple, or other iterable object.\\nFor example:\\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\\nprint(len(my_list))\\n# Output : 5\\n\\n3. input() - This function is used to get input from the user via the console or terminal. It can be used to prompt the user for text or numerical input.\\nFor example:\\nname = input(\"What is your name : ?\")\\nprint(\"Hello, \" + name + \"!\")\\n\\n4. type() - This function is used to get the type of an object in Python. It can be used to check the type of a variable or value.\\nFor example:\\nx = 5\\nprint(type(x))\\n# Output : <class \\'int\\'>\\n\\n5. range() - This function is used to generate a range of numbers, which can be used in for loops or other iterations.\\nFor example:\\nfor i in range(1, 6):\\n    print(i)\\n# Output:\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n\\nThese are just a few examples of the many built-in functions available in Python.
